# C++ Data Structures and Utilities

This repository contains a collection of foundational C++ projects developed by Joshua Moorehead. The projects demonstrate core concepts in data structures, memory management, class design, and problem-solving using custom libraries and simulations.

##  Projects Overview

### `array_class/`
Implements a custom fixed-size array class with basic operations such as insert, remove, and print. Useful for demonstrating memory layout, bounds handling, and loop-based logic.

### `templated_array_class/`
An enhanced version of the array class using C++ templates, allowing reuse with multiple data types. Shows template syntax, instantiation, and type safety.

### `binary_search_tree/`
An early version of a BST implementation, accompanied by a statistics library and test inputs. Demonstrates recursion, tree traversal, and C++ modularity.

### `bst_standalone/`
Standalone binary search tree implementation with clean structure and focused logic. Emphasizes classic data structure design.

### `custom_string_class/`
Implements a custom string class with dynamic memory handling, overloaded operators, and standard string manipulation functions. Includes additional test files in the `tests/` subfolder.

### `locker_simulation/`
Solves the classic "100 locker doors" logic puzzle using loops and toggling logic. Simple but illustrative of problem-solving and modular code.

## Usage

Each folder is self-contained. To compile any project:

```bash
cd folder_name/
g++ *.cpp -o runme
./runme
```

(Some folders may include test drivers like `main.cpp` or `6Tester.cpp`.)
